# Ping-Pong
Fun simple ping pong game.

Hello welcome to my simple ping pong game!

The repository contain a prototype of the ping pong game. It is a multiplayer game but only on 1 device.
The game was implemented in Python using the Pygame Liabary :)

Player 1 controls the left paddle using the "w" and "s" keys while player 2 control the right paddle using the "up arrow" and the "down arrow" keys.

Have fun playing with this simple game :)
